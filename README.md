# A-Bioinformatics-Toolkit-for-DNA-and-RNA-Analysis
A specialized Python CLI tool for preliminary genomic analysis. It streamlines DNA/RNA validation, GC-content calculation, and reverse complement generation. Designed with a modular architecture (project.py, test_project.py), it uses optimized maketrans logic for high-performance processing of large-scale molecular biology datasets.
